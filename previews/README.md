# Catalog previews

Every current package has a hash-pinned PNG preview under 256 KiB.

- `ocean.png` is the original synthetic native Ocean-theme screenshot.
- `forest-piano.png` and `soft-white.png` are 640x360 downscaled copies of their
  packaged covers, retaining the artwork's existing package provenance and terms.
- Other theme previews render Serein's synthetic workspace with the corresponding
  packaged theme applied in dark mode, including its spacing and typography.
- Plugin previews render the synthetic workspace with a preserved deleted message
  or the sticker picker and sample artwork. No live account or Discord traffic is used.

These ten previews were rendered by Serein's existing `profile_preview` example at
`ddbed3c456167e827d088aeac3ae74db46c07744`, using a 1280x720 window and its built-in
640x360 thumbnail export. They are captures of the actual egui framebuffer, not
drawn mockups, OS window-capture evidence, or proof of live interoperability.

Reproduce from that Serein revision, replacing `ID` with the package's manifest ID:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p serein --features demo --example profile_preview -- --demo --extension=ID --width=1280 --height=720 --thumbnail --output=preview.png
```

Synthetic UI previews use the repository's MIT OR Apache-2.0 license. Package
bytes are unchanged. To replace a preview, commit its PNG and regenerate the catalog
as described in the root README so its URL, SHA-256, and byte count stay pinned.
